# SimulScrub

SimulScrub is a Max for Live device that plays a number of contiguous time segments of an audio file simultaneously, with a flexible crossfader control to select which segment(s) you want to hear.

[![How it Looks](images/device.gif)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=574H1rq7Tkg)

This allows you to scrub through time of a longer sample, while always playing the sample at 1x speed. ðŸ¤¯

In the screen capture above, the yellow lines represent virtual "playheads" playing from your sample at that position. The blue bars coming in from the left represent the volume that the respective playhead will actually play. The position is controlled via slider to the left, with control over the width of the pickup pattern.

SimulScrub has a simple drag and drop workflow. Just drag an audio sample or file to the main plugin area and play any MIDI note to start playing. Automate or modulate the `Position` slider and `Width` knob. See how different numbers of slices (up to 32) changes things.

## Installation

[Download the newest release](https://github.com/zsteinkamp/m4l-SimulScrub/releases) or clone this repository, and drag the `SimulScrub.amxd` device into a track in Ableton Live.

## Changelog

- 2024-04-27 [v2](https://github.com/zsteinkamp/m4l-SimulScrub/releases/download/v2/SimulScrub-v2.amxd) - Fix looping; Add stop/start effect control; fix reverse bug.
- 2024-04-13 [v1](https://github.com/zsteinkamp/m4l-SimulScrub/releases/download/v1/SimulScrub-v1.amxd) - Initial Release.

## Usage

Add this device to a MIDI track, then drag an audio clip or file to the main plugin area.

Send any MIDI note to the device. Hold the note.

Select the number of slices with the `Divisions` knob. You will need to re-press the MIDI note when changing the number of divisions (bug noted below).

Select which slice you are hearing with the `Position` slider.

Control how many adjacent slices are also heard with the `Width` knob.

## Background

I created this plugin after using my [Chiastic Slide](https://github.com/zsteinkamp/m4l-ChiasticSlide) plugin to do this job using an instrument rack with N chains, each containing a Simpler device playing its own slide of a larger audio file. Setting that up was a fairly involved process and cumbersome to operate to keep N Simplers in sync, parameter-wise (even using "Copy to (n) siblings").

## TODO

* Slice by ms, measures
* Reverse toggle
* Gracefully handle changing Divisions - currently have to restart the note; should be seamless

## Contributing

I'd love it if others extended this device. If you would like to contribute, simply fork this repo, make your changes, and open a pull request and I'll have a look.
